Goals
--------

The purpose of this project was to support multiple payment gateways, but through one entry to record a payment. It supports PayPal, PayPal Pro, Google CheckOut, Authorize.net, Authorize.net Automated Recurring Billing (ARB), and 2CheckOut. Some classes were already created by 3rd parties, and adapted to use a single entry-point for all gateways.
